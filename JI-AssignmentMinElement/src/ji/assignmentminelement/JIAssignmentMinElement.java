/*
 * [OBJECTIVE]
 * Write a method called readIntegers() with a parameter called count that represents how many integers the user needs to enter.
 * The method needs to read from the console until all the numbers are entered, and then return an array containing the numbers entered.
 * Write a method findMin() with the array as a parameter. The method needs to return the minimum value in the array.
 * In the main() method read the count from the console and call the method readIntegers() with the count parameter. 
 * Then call the findMin() method passing the array returned from the call to the readIntegers() method.
 * Finally, print the minimum element in the array.
