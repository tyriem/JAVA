OBJECTIVE: A Book club awards points based on the number of books read each month (as follows)
If a member reads 0 books, they earn 0 points.
If a member reads 1 books, they earn 5 points.
If a member reads 2 books, they earn 15 points.
If a member reads 3 books, they earn 30 points.
If a member reads 4 or more books, they earn 60 points.
