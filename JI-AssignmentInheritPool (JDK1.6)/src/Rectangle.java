/*
 * [OBJECTIVE]
 *  Write a class with the name Rectangle. The class needs two fields (instance variable) with name width and length both of type double.
 *  The class needs to have one constructor with parameters width and length both of type double and it needs to initialize the fields.
 *  In case the width parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the width field value to 0.
 *  In case the length parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the length field value to 0.
 *  Write the following methods (instance methods):
 *  Method named getWidth without any parameters, it needs to return the value of width field.
 *  Method named getLength without any parameters, it needs to return the value of length field.
 *  Method named getArea without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated area (width * length).
 *
 *  Write a class with the name Cuboid that extends Rectangle class. The class needs one field (instance variable) with name height of type double.
 *  The class needs to have one constructor with three parameters width, length, and height all of type double. It needs to call parent constructor and initialize a height field.
 *  In case the height parameter is less than 0 it needs to set the height field value to 0.
 *  Write the following methods (instance methods):
 *  Method named getHeight without any parameters, it needs to return the value of height field.
 *  Method named getVolume without any parameters, it needs to return the calculated volume. To calculate volume multiply the area with height.
 * REQUIRES JDK VERSION <= 1.6
