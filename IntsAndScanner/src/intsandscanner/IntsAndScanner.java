///WHEN USING A SCANNER AND AN INTEGER BE SURE TO: 1) PLACE THE SCANNER BEFORE THE INT 2) CALL THE nextLine twice 3) Just use the kb.next(); command (this is more vague and isn't string specific but would work) 4)WRAP THE SCANNER IN A Integer.parseInt:
//WHEN THE USER ENTERS THE INTEGER BEFORE THE STRING IT STORES THE NUMBER IN THE BUFFER, THE NEXTINT TAKES THE NUMERIC INPUT, THE NEXT LINE COMMAND WOULDN'T WORK AS IT ALREADY SEES THE CARRIAGE RETURN LEFT IN THE BUFFER (THIS IS BECAUSE nextLine reads any characters while nextInt only reads the numbers)
    
//EX. 1 PLACE THE SCANNER BEFORE THE INT
//Ask the user to enter a number
   System.out.println("Please Enter a word:");
   //Pull the user input into the memory buffer
