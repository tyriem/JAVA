/*
 *[OBJECTIVE]
 * Your task is to create a simple Maths Tutor program. User picks Addition or Subtraction. program chooses two random numbers (between 1 and 10 inclusive) and displays a problem for the user to solve.
 * The user can then enter the answer to the problem. If correct: program must display a nice msg. If incorrect: Program must tell them and display the correct answer. For subtraction the smaller number must always be subtracted from the larger.
